Sentimental analysis of movie reviews in the NLTK library. 

See the [notebook](https://github.com/bibek-huma/sentiment_analysis_naive_bayes/blob/master/Naive%20Bayes%20Implementation%20to%20build%20a%20predictive%20model.ipynb) for implementation.

# If negative review exceeds the count of positive review then acknowedge the outcome and benevolently request a brainstorming or, JAD session with the board for favorable/better outcome.
